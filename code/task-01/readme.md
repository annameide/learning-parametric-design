# task 01

The first task was to create an artwork similar to an artist we like. I chose ["Carmen Herrara"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Herrera).

## colorful iterations

You can find my final code in the sketch.js file. Here are some iterations I did by exporting the file as an SVG and coloring it in the typical Carmen Herrera colors in Figma.
