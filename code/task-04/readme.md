# task 04

The fourth task was to code a hand drawn sketch by a fellow student or just some aspects of it.

## the sketch

## the result

My proposed solution is a combination of a for loop to draw the waves and the use of a code snippet from a previouss class. I opted for a combination, since combining code snippets seems to be a good and common practice.

## open questions

I would like to know if it is possible to combine a custom shape – here a rectangle – with the wave (line) in order to get a shape that can get a fill, so that the hatching is only seen in parts of the sketch.
